# XGoldie

XGoldie is an animation of a dancing girl for the X11 Window System.

It is based on WGOLDIE.EXE for Windows 3.1 written by Walter Prodorutti.

I have extracted the original bitmaps from WGOLDIE.EXE and converted them to the XBM format.

Prodorutti created WGOLDIE.EXE based on an animation he found on a Mac, however, I'm unable to find any information on this original version.
